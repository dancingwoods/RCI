RCI is an R package that I am working on as part of my thesis.  

It contains R code to perform various analysis tasks on calcium imaging data.  

It is not currently finished to a point that it is distributed through CRAN, but should be in a few months.
At that point, the R package will be released along with documentation (and tutorials?)
